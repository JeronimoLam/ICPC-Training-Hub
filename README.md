# Welcome to the ICPC-Training-Hub!

This repository is created by Jeronimo Lambre, Matias Zeballos, and Tomas McNally, three competitive programmers from the National University of La Plata (UNLP). We've created this hub to share our journey as we train for various programming contests, including the prestigious ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest).

What's Inside?

* Practice Problems: A collection of problems we've tackled, featuring our solutions and detailed explanations.
* Learning Resources: Notes and resources on algorithms, data structures, and other essential topics.

While this repository primarily serves as a personal training log for us, we welcome anyone interested in competitive programming to explore and learn. Whether you're a fellow competitor, a student, or just someone curious about algorithmic challenges, feel free to dive into the code and discussions!
